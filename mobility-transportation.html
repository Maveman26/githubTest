        Arlington - AV On-Demand Shuttle Deployment: The City of Arlington has
        partnered with Via, May Mobility, and UT Arlington to launch the RAPID
        pilot program, the first autonomous driving shuttle initiative to
        integrate with an existing public transportation service. The City of
        Arlington recognized the need for effective, efficient, and accessible
        transportation for all riders. Made possible by a grant from the Federal
        Transit Administration (FTA), the city decided to combine on-demand
        rideshare with autonomous technology to make local transportation as
        safe as possible. In 2021, May Mobility began operating four autonomous
        Lexus shuttles, alongside one wheelchair-accessible Polaris GEM shuttle,
        as part of an expansion of the RAPID (Rideshare, Automation, and Payment
        Integration Demonstration) program. The May Lexus shuttles, like the
        current May GEM shuttles, will be staffed by a Fleet Attendant and will
        operate on Arlington roads.

        North Texas - Autonomous Trucking Hub: Did you know Texas is the most
        popular location for autonomous freight movement pilot programs? Dallas
        and Houston are two of the biggest freight hubs in the U.S. Major
        transportation and technology companies including Aurora, TuSimple,
        Waymo, and Kodiak Robotics all have major operations in the region.
        Freight transportation is a key component in the DFW regional economy.
        The North Texas region is located along Interstate Highway 35, which has
        served as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) corridor since
        1995. The region is also home to a national freight railroad crossroads
        and national and international air cargo hub, making it a national
        logistics hub. Within 48 hours, 98 percent of the U.S. population can be
        reached from this region by truck.

        International (DFW) Airport’s Innovation Team partnered with IBM Watson
        and Soul Machines to develop and trial an artificial
        intelligence-powered digital human concierge. During the trial, the
        digital human concierge provided passengers at the airport on-demand,
        voice-based answers to their questions from her temporary location in
        Terminal A. DFW Airport has become the first airport to merge IBM Watson
        artificial intelligence with Soul Machines Digital DNA to create a
        digital concierge. The DFW Airport Innovation Team will use results of
        the test program to evaluate the digital concierge’s future potential at
        DFW. As it aims to become the “airport of the future”, DFW says it is
        committed to staying a step ahead of its customers, who are increasingly
        choosing on-demand voice-based technology when seeking information on
        their smart phones or other devices.

        traffic-control boxes that sync traffic lights to traffic flow,
        high-efficiency light-emitting diode streetlights that also will be

        the late 2010's, the recommendation for building a community deck park
        over the highway to reconnect these two neighborhoods was approved. The
        Southern Gateway Park is the largest capital project of its kind in the
        history of Southern Dallas, $47 million of which is dedicated to
        building the infrastructure to support the park. The design and

        million. Construction is underway, with Phase 1 of the park opening set
        for 2023. This 2.8 acres Phase I of the park will include features
        including a multi-purpose pavilion, large lawn, pavilion, children's

        study the potential of drone technology and integrate it into future
        transportation plans. NASA will work with NCTCOG and a group of public-
        and private-sector partners to study cargo-carrying drones and automated
        air taxis during a series of at least four future workshops. NASA has
        been engaged with the Federal Aviation Administration and other regions
        about how to integrate Advanced Air Mobility technologies such as
        drones, also called unmanned aircraft systems, into metropolitan areas.
        Drones are becoming more common for use in business, public safety and
        recreational purposes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, NCTCOG has been
        hosting monthly virtual workshops to help professional operators and
        hobbyists remain up to date on the rules and regulations governing drone
        use, as well as best practices.

        Autonomous vehicles in McKinney: Feonix Mobility Rising, a nonprofit

        during a Feb. 1 work session for support on a program that would provide
        necessities to residents. The program, informally called the Wellness
        Wagon, would deploy two self-driving vehicles to deliver fresh food and
        non-narcotic medications to McKinney’s underserved population. The North
        Central Texas Council of Governments is collaborating with Feonix on the
        project. The Wellness Wagon would serve those living in poverty, people
        with disabilities and senior citizens. McKinney has more than 13,000
        people living at or below the federal poverty level, according to the
        presentation. In addition to deliveries, the Wellness Wagon would be
        designed as a telehealth resource. Vehicles would have designated
        parking locations—for example, a patient’s residence or in the parking
        lot of a senior center—for patients to virtually visit with healthcare
        providers.
